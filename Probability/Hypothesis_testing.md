Hypothesis testing is a statistical procedure used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha), and using statistical methods to assess the evidence against the null hypothesis.

Here are the key steps involved in hypothesis testing:

Formulate the Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H0): It represents the default or null assumption. It states that there is no significant difference, relationship, or effect in the population. It is often denoted as H0: μ = μ0 or H0: p = p0, where μ represents a population mean and p represents a population proportion.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha): It represents the opposite of the null hypothesis. It states that there is a significant difference, relationship, or effect in the population. It can be one-sided (H1: μ > μ0 or H1: p > p0, indicating a directional effect) or two-sided (H1: μ ≠ μ0 or H1: p ≠ p0, indicating a non-directional effect).
Select the Significance Level (α):

The significance level (α) determines the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. It represents the maximum acceptable probability of making a Type I error, which is the error of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Commonly used significance levels are 0.05 (5%) and 0.01 (1%).
Choose the Test Statistic and Distribution:

The choice of the test statistic depends on the nature of the data and the hypothesis being tested. Commonly used test statistics include the t-statistic, z-statistic, chi-squared statistic, and F-statistic. The choice of the test statistic is often guided by assumptions about the population and sample size.
The distribution of the test statistic is determined by the null hypothesis and the sample size. Common distributions used in hypothesis testing include the t-distribution, standard normal (z) distribution, chi-squared distribution, and F-distribution.
Collect Sample Data and Calculate the Test Statistic:

Collect a representative sample from the population of interest.
Compute the test statistic based on the sample data, using the appropriate formula or statistical software.
Determine the Critical Region and Compute the P-value:

The critical region is the range of values of the test statistic that leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis. It is determined by the significance level (α) and the distribution of the test statistic.
The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed test statistic under the null hypothesis. It quantifies the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. If the p-value is smaller than the significance level (α), the null hypothesis is rejected.
Make a Conclusion:

Compare the p-value to the significance level (α). If the p-value is less than α, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than or equal to α, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The conclusion is based on the evidence provided by the sample data.
