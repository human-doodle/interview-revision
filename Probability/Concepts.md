## Markov Chain:
A Markov chain is a mathematical concept used to study systems that change over time. It involves a sequence of events or states where the probability of transitioning from one state to another depends only on the current state and not on the history of how you got there.

Markov chains have a wide range of applications in various fields. Here are a few examples:

1. Natural Language Processing: Markov chains are used in language modeling and text generation tasks. They can be used to predict the next word in a sentence based on the current word or to generate new sentences that resemble a given text. For instance, auto-complete suggestions on your smartphone or computer often utilize Markov chains.
2. Finance and Economics: Markov chains are employed in analyzing financial markets and economic models. They can help predict stock prices, market trends, and economic indicators. By modeling the behavior of market conditions, investors and economists can make informed decisions about investments and economic policies.
3. Simulation and Modeling: Markov chains are useful in simulating and modeling various systems. They can simulate complex systems by representing different states and the probabilities of transitioning between those states. For example, they can be used to model the movement of particles, the spread of diseases, or the behavior of customers in a queue.
4. Machine Learning: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), a type of Markov chain, are used in speech recognition, gesture recognition, and other pattern recognition tasks. HMMs are particularly useful when the underlying process or sequence of events is not directly observable, but only the resulting outputs or observations are available.
5. Web Ranking Algorithms: Markov chains are utilized in web ranking algorithms like Google's PageRank. In these algorithms, web pages are treated as states, and the transitions between pages are based on links. By analyzing the structure of the web and the probabilities of transitions, these algorithms determine the importance and relevance of web pages.

So,  Markov chains are a way to understand and predict how things change over time. Imagine you have a system that can be in different states, like a weather system with states such as sunny, cloudy, or rainy.

A Markov chain helps us figure out the probability of moving from one state to another. For example, if it's sunny today, there might be a 70% chance it will be sunny tomorrow, a 20% chance it will be cloudy, and a 10% chance it will be rainy.
